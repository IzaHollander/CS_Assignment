Create one plot from the dataset "istherecorrelation.csv", with DPI=300. 
The objective is to visualize the data in a way that you consider representative. 
Include the resulting plot image in the markdown file and add a few lines of interpretation on the data.
Commit and push these two files to your fork.
Create a pull request for me to this (the original) repo. 
(Hint: you can use the "New pull request" button and then do a "compare across forks").
You are done, I will see the pull requests and check your work.
