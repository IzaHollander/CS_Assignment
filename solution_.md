    Create one plot from the dataset "istherecorrelation.csv", with DPI=300. The objective is to visualize the data in a way that you consider representative. Include the resulting plot image in the markdown file and add a few lines of interpretation on the data.
    Commit and push these two files to your fork.
    Create a pull request for me to this (the original) repo. (Hint: you can use the "New pull request" button and then do a "compare across forks").
    You are done, I will see the pull requests and check your work.
