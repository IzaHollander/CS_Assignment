The plot visualizes the correlation between 'WO [x1000]' and 'NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]' for each year.
It seems that as 'WO [x1000]' increases, 'NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]' also tends to increase, especially from 2013 onwards.
This suggests a positive correlation. While a correlation exists, this does not directly imply causation, as other factors may contribute to the observed relationship.
